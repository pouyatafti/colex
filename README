`colex' is a small package for studying colour properties of digital images,
that I coded during my 2006 new year break.  I would have liked to clean up and
document the code and correct some mistakes, but that may not happen any time
soon (if ever) as I probably won't find the time.  As such, I am releasing it
in its present unpolished form.  Feel free to contact me at the address below
with your comments, etc., but please do not feel offended should I not be able
to implement your suggestions or to answer your questions in great detail.


compiling and running
---------------------

You will need plan9port[1], a recent version of libtiff[2], and possibly other
dependencies.  After installing these go into `colex/src/' and type:

    mk

The binaries will be placed in `colex/bin/'.  There is a script there named
`colex.rc' that takes a tiff file as a command line argument and requires a
named pipe in `colex/bin/' named `cmd' for communication between the component.

The GUI roughly follows the Plan9 GUI philosophy.  Clicking each mouse button
in programme windows brings up a menu.

This was my first experience in (pseudo-)plan9 programming, as well as in
multi-threaded programming and GUIs.  Don't expect much.
